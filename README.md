# window-reset
Moves windows that are not on the primary screen back to the primary screen. Currently only works with windows.

## Building
Open the solution in Visual Studio (preferably 2019) and click build.

## Running
Run window-reset.exe. The program currently does not support any configuration or commandline parameters.
When the program is launched press CTRL+ALT+M to move the windows to the primary screen. This is not configurable either.
